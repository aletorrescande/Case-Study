## **Business Activities**

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** <br>
Betterment is trying to make money and investment management simple and affordable. Investing and managing money can be a complex and overwhelming task for many people. Additionally, not only is it expensive to be able to afford a Fincial advisor, but it typically requires a large minimum investment to open an account. By using technology, the company also mitigates behavioral and emotional biases when managing portfolios. The online platform allows customers to manage their investments on their own time without the need for in-person meetings, calls or paperwork.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** <br>
The company's intended customer varies from experienced to first time investors. The platform is designed to manage the investment process on behalf of the client via their robo-advisor. This innovative investment model takes the place of a traditional financial advisor by managing all the data analysis and executing investment strategies for each client based on their financial goals. Customers can still manage their own investment strategy to the extent they desire. Betterment won the Investopedia's best robo-advisors for beginners category due to its easy to use platform, its accesibility (allowing individuals to start investing with a minimum of $10), practical education resources, and intuitive guidance [3](#reference-3). As of April 30, 2023 Betterment's reported a customer count of 800,000+ and $36+ Billion in assets under management [4](#reference-4)
