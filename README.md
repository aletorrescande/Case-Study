The growth capital was compromised of $60 million from a Series F equity round and $100 million from a debt financing round. The first Series A funding round was in December 2010 for $3 million, followed by a series B equity run in October 2012 for $10 million. The third Series C round took place in April 2014 for $32 million and a fourth Series D round was in February 2015 for $60 million. The fifth and sixth Series E took place in March 2016 for $100 million and July 2017 for $70 million. The investors of this company include: Kinnevik, Citi Ventures, Francisco Partners and Aflac Global Ventures. Additionally, Betterment has acquired 3 organizations, the latest being crypto manager Makara in February 2022. This last acquisition gave them the ability to add diversified crypto portfolios to their investments.[2](#reference-2)


## **Business Activities**

**What problem does Betterment solve?** <br>
Betterment is trying to make money and investment management simple and affordable. Investing and managing money can be a complex and overwhelming task for many people. Not only is it expensive to be able to afford a financial advisor, but it typically requires a large minimum investment to open an account. By using technology, the company also mitigates behavioral and emotional biases when managing portfolios. The online platform allows customers to manage their investments on their own time without the need for in-person meetings, calls, or paperwork.

**Company's customers** <br>
The company's intended customer varies from experienced to first time investors. The platform is designed to manage the investment process on behalf of the client via their robo-advisor. This innovative investment model takes the place of a traditional financial advisor by managing all the data analysis and executing investment strategies for each client based on their financial goals. Customers can still manage their own investment strategies to the extent they desire. Betterment won the Investopedia's best robo-advisors for beginners category due to its easy to use platform, its affordability, practical education resources, and intuitive guidance [3](#reference-3). As of April 30, 2023 Betterment's reported a customer count of 800,000+ and $36+ Billion in assets under management. [4](#reference-4)

**Betterment's Competitive Advantage**<br>
By being the pioneer of robo-advisors, the company has well established credibility and market allocation. One of the reasons why robo-advisor users choose Betterment is their simple and easy to use platform. The guided onboarding and funding process are very straightforward. Another reason is their affordability, customers can start investing with as little as $10 and they have competitive low-fees for investment management. Additionally, they offer great cash management options, including no fee checking and savings accounts. Offering this additional services increases consumer interactions in the platform.

Betterment does not follow the regular customer-centric approach but a centered client outcome approach. The strategies they provide align closely to the customers' needs and goals. One of the ways they help their clients reach their goals is by sending messages "during periods of market turmoil to help consumers re-calibrate risk, for instance, or calculate the tax implications of purchases with the Tax Impact Preview feature" [10](#reference-10). Giving this information in a timely matter, has prevented clients from making irrational and wrong investment decisions. 

Betterment also goes beyond managing clients investments by allowing customers to connect external accounts. By knowing the clients' overall asset allocation, Betterment can offer a more holistic approach to investing. This also allows its users to have a more complete picture of their finances. Betterment offers customers' access to a human Financial Advisor when their investments reach $100,000+. Furthermore, "Betterment goes beyond the typical offerings from robo-advisors, providing an income-focused, bond-centric portfolio, and several socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolio choices, as well as providing access to third-party portfolios managed by BlackRock and Goldman Sachs"[9](#reference-9). Clients also have the option of Flexible portfolios where they can adjust specific asset class weightings.

**How does Betterment's Robo-Advisor work?**<br>
Surprisingly, Betterment's robo-advisor does not use machine learning. After exploring the possibility of using machine learning for portfolio generation, they found that the simpler approaches they were using were showing more effective results. The company's robo-advisor "involves a lot of math and statistical modeling with the crux depending on two different models averaged together" [6](#reference-6). In one of their techniques, Monte Carlo Simulations is used to simulate multiple market environments and creating portfolios for each of those scenarios. They then choose the better portfolio. The other model is based on the Black-Litterman model. By using these models, they adapt the portfolios according to the customer's risk tolerance, time-frame and financial goals. Ultimately, they provide advice on the expected outcomes for the generated portfolios. It is important to note that "even though Betterment doesn’t use machine learning widely, the technology does factor into some of its offerings". [6](#reference-6)

Robo-advisors work by the use algorithms and sophisticated software. There are many programs that Betterment uses for developing models, algorithms, codes and software testing. Some of the programs and tools include [8](#reference-8): 
1. **Julia and Ruby:** the Quantitive Investment Team uses Julia to power projections and recommendations to the app and Ruby for the development of production code.
2. **Flutter:** used for their moblie application and used to create a [Charlatan](https://www.betterment.com/engineering/end-to-end-ish-tests-using-fake-http-in-flutter) a fake HTTP configuration to test software.
3. **WebValve:** is also used for testing software.
4. **Service Level Objevtive (SLO)**: to be able lo measure SLO Betterment uses some of this tools **StatsD** or **Micrometer** and **DataDog**.
5. **GitHub**
6. **CircleCI**: to provide CI/CD to the company's engineers.
7. **SQL databases**


## **Fintech Domain and Company Results**<br>

Betterment is in the Robo-Advising Domain. Robo-advisors use algorithms to give investment advice and create protfolios tailored to users' needs. This domain has been experiencing rapid growth and increasing popularity over the recent years and it's expected to keep growing. Established firms such as Merril Lynch and Goldman Sacks have also launched robo-advisory platforms. 

According to Statista, assets under management in the robo-advisor industry in the US is expected to reach $1.7tn in 2023 and have an annual growh of 14.52% leading to a projected total amount of $2.02tn by 2027. Additionally, in 2021 the demographics of the robo-advisor industry was compromised of ~60% male and ~40% female. 52% of the users where reported to have high net income, 23% medium income and 25% low income.

**Trends and Innovations**<br>
The rapid advancements in technology have had a significant impact in the robo advisory domain. Machine learning, advanced analytics, the cloud, blockchain, and software developments have increased the effectiveness of not just robo-advisory, but the overall experience of users while using their platforms [9](#reference-9). Over the past years, robo-advising companies have been expanding the investment options they provide and this trend is sure to continue. Robo-Advising is facing the challenge of keeping up with cybersecurity and strict regulation compliance. They also need to keep innovating their testing softwares to evaluate their technology performance, the effectiveness of their results and regulatory compliance. 

**Company's role in Domain**<br>
Betterment made robo-advising available to general investors for the first time in 2010, disrupting the financial service industry and creating a new market in weatlh management. The company made investment management easy and affordable, growing the audience of wealth management to many who could not afford a Financial Advisor. To date, the company has been advancing on the services they provide including crypto diversified portfolios, tax loss harvesting, and socially responsible investments. They are constantly innovating their testing software methods. Betterment is constantly improving the user experience for its customers by providing practical educational materials for better understanding their investments. 

Despite being the largest robo-advisory firm in the US, the company needs to continually innovate and adapt to stay ahead of their increasing competitors. Betterment leads the way of innovating user experience with their sophisticated data streaming system. "Betterment segments audiences and looks for opportunities to help them improve their finances in the consumer, advisor and employer markets" [10](#reference-10). This approach led them to create new products such as employer space, student loan management, and cryptocurrency portfolios. 

**Company's competitors and Major players**<br>
The company's competitors and major players of Robo-Advising include: Wealthfront, Empower, M1 Finance, Personal Capital and Interactive Advisors, Charles Schwab. Some established firms are also launching robo-advisors, including: Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, Fidelity Go, Goldman Sacks (with Marcus) and Merril lynch (with Merrill Guided Investing)


## **Recommendations**

My recommendation would be exploring the possibility of offering mutual funds to be more competitive. Giving the option of purchasing mutual funds could attract more experiences investors and increase AUM of existing clients. Following their customer-outcome approach, mutual funds could become part of the investment strategies offered to clients with little experience which they might not have been able to access outside of Betterment. Additionlly, I would recommend looking into borrowing and lending services. This new product could be another source of revenue. Betterment could use their current database to assess clients credit scores for this new service. 

Betterment could adapt existing models and portfolio management algorithms to include mutual funds. Adapting existing engineering abstractions for borrowing and lending services could present more complexity. They can follow similar approach as they did for incorporating Tax Coordinated Portfolios for examining this possible product [11](#reference-11). The company can take advantage of being the largest Robo-Advisory firm by using their data and existing users to expand their provided services. I believe this could strenghten customers' interactions with the company, ultimately bringing more inflow.
