# Betterment- The first Robo-Advisor

## **Company's History**
The company chosen for this case study was Betterment. It was founded in August 2008 by Jonathan Stein, Sean Owen, Ryan O’Sullivan and Eli Broverman and launched in 2010 at TechCrunch Disrupt. Jonathan Stein earned a bachelor's degree in Economics from Harvard Univesrsity in 2001 and MBA from Columbia Business School in 2009. Jonathan founded Bettermen to address the challenges he encountered through managing his own investments. Betterment was created with the idea of simplyfing the complex investment landscape for its users by creating a platform that uses technology to provide personalized investment and money management advice to its customers.

Betterment has raised $435 million over ten funding rounds from several investors. The latest round was on September 2021 for $160 million, leading to a total valuation of $1.3 billion. The growth capital was compromised of $60 million from a Series F equity round and $100 million from a debt financing round. The first funding round was in December 2010 for $3 million (Series A), followed by a series B equity run in October 2012 for $10 million, third round was in April 2014 for $32 million (Series C), fourth round was in February 2015 for $60 million (Series D), fifth round was in March 2016 for $100 million (Series E) and another series E equity run in July 2017 for $70 million.

This last acquisition gave them the ability to add diversified crypto portfolios to their investments. [2](#reference-2)


## **Business Activities**

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** <br>
Betterment is trying to make money and investment management simple and affordable. Investing and managing money can be a complex and overwhelming task for many people. Additionally, not only is it expensive to be able to afford a Financial advisor, but it typically requires a large minimum investment to open an account. By using technology, the company also mitigates behavioral and emotional biases when managing portfolios. The online platform allows customers to manage their investments on their own time without the need for in-person meetings, calls or paperwork.

**Who is the company's intended customer?** <br>
The company's intended customer varies from experienced to first time investors. The platform is designed to manage the investment process on behalf of the client via their robo-advisor. This innovative investment model takes the place of a traditional financial advisor by managing all the data analysis and executing investment strategies for each client based on their financial goals. Customers can still manage their own investment strategy to the extent they desire. Betterment won the Investopedia's best robo-advisors for beginners category due to its easy to use platform, its accesibility (allowing individuals to start investing with a minimum of $10), practical education resources, and intuitive guidance [3](#reference-3). As of April 30, 2023 Betterment's reported a customer count of 800,000+ and $36+ Billion in assets under management. [4](#reference-4)

## **Recommendations**

My recommendation would be offering another service where clients could integrate their external investments accounts to perform an overral analysis of their asset allocation. This could offer a better understading of their clients situation and goals and offer a better investment strategy. The investment strategy that Betterment would offer would take into account what their clients have outside their platform which would result in a more accurate recommendation on where to invest through them. For example, if a client has more equity overall in other platfoms the robo-advisor could recommend a portfolio containing more debt (always contemplating the clients goals, needs and risk tolerance). Offering this additional service could potentially benefit Betterment's overall market share and increase revenue. For this, the company could use the algorithms and code strategy it is currently using for analysing and creating portfolios. The process of integrating this new service would employ similar data analysis as it does for integrating portfolios. The robo-advisor would take into account this new information as a new variable along with the other variables it currently uses to create, adjust and reallocate portfolios. 

Additionally, I would recommend the company to explore the possibility of offering mutual funds to make it more competitive with other companies.
